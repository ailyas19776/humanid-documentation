# Contributing to humanID

## Implementing Features

If you'd like to implement or improve features for humanID, start a discussion on on the humanID Global [WhatsApp](http://bit.ly/humanID_SSO) group first. We welcome all ideas but they may not be appropriate for the humanID core. Consider whether your idea could be developed as a plugin.

## Contribution Rules

When writing code you intend to submit to humanID, please follow the coding conventions outlined [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) for Android. If you don't follow these guidelines, your code will likely not be accepted.

## Submitting Code

If you've completed a feature or found and fixed the cause of a bug in the humanID code, you can submit your work back to the humanID repository. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a fork of the repository
2. Make the changes in your fork 
3. Click "submit pull request" 

Bug fix pull requests must be targeted to the bugfix branch. Pull requests for new features or large code changes must be made to the dev branch.

Please add yourself to the contributors.txt once submitted. 

## Code Review

All code submitted through pull requests will require review before implementation.
