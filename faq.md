### Company

<details>
<summary> 1. Who are we?</summary><br>
<p>humanID's leadership team includes experienced cyber-security experts, seasoned entrepreneurs, and graduates from some of the best schools in the United States - but most importantly is driven by the contributions in time and money from all across the world, including more than 20 volunteers spread globally between Jakarta and San Francisco. We were remote and on Zoom before everyone else!</p>

<details>
<summary> 2. What is the long term vision humanID wants to achieve?</summary><br>
<p>humanID's vision is to provide ONE anonymous, safe and protected digital identity to every human, enabling civil online communities without surveillance or discriminiation.<br><br></p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 3. How does humanID help combat fake news?</summary><br>
<p>Fake news is spread largely through bots, trolls, and individuals controlling a large number of accounts. humanID makes it more difficult and more costly to create multiple accounts aligned with our vision of only one digital identity per human being. We are creating multiple protection layers to stop the creation of bot networks, among them the requirement of a unique phone number.<br><br></p>

<details>
<summary> 4. Why is humanID more secure & trustworthy than other options?</summary><br>
<p>humanID is more secure & trustworthy because we don't store any of your information on our servers or communicate it to the applications you're using. Our data is hashed in a way that cannot be reversed, so even if our database -- or that of our partner applications -- is leaked, it will not be of use to any malicious actors. 
It will also be impossible for governments or other people to identify your real-life identity or get your phone number.<br><br></p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 5. Why are we an open source project?</summary><br>
<p>Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption and collaboration, allowing people to spread and improve projects quickly. Developers can take on projects, review them to give feedback, or build on something better on top of existing code. <br><br>
In addition, humanID is all about trust. We ask users to trust us that we don't save or sell their data. Users have been given false promises on that too many times. We have two ways we justify that trust: being non-profit (no profit incentives to break our promise), and being open source (no ability to do anything secretly without users knowing).<br><br></p>

### Product

<details>
<summary> 1. Is humanID's login really anonymous?</summary><br>
<p>humanID initially verifies your phone number to ensure you're a unique user. During this minute, you're not entirely anonymous. But we then delete your phone number and only save a random identifier ("hash") as a key. We give platforms yet another random ID as your identifier - this way each platform knows you under a different identifier, and they cannot mix and match your data. This means for platforms, you are entirely anonymous when you enter, and humanID has no way of recovering your information once you verify your phone number.<br><br></p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> 2. What information do platforms receive when users log in?
</summary><br>
<p>A very long, random number. The only other data we communicate and save is the country-code of your phone number (e.g. +1 for US/CA), so communities can adjust their offering accordingly (to change language, for example). That's all.<br><br></p>
